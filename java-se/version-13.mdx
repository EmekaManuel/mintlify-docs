## Java SE 13

Released: **September 17, 2019**

Java SE 13 introduced several preview features and improvements.

## Key Features

### Text Blocks (Preview)

Multi-line string literals that improve readability:

```java
String html = """
    <html>
        <body>
            <p>Hello, World</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    """;
```

### Switch Expressions (Preview)

Enhanced switch statements with expression syntax:

```java
int numLetters = switch (day) {
    case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> 6;
    case TUESDAY -> 7;
    case THURSDAY, SATURDAY -> 8;
    case WEDNESDAY -> 9;
};
```

### Reimplement the Legacy Socket API

The underlying implementation of the `java.net.Socket` and `java.net.ServerSocket` APIs has been replaced with a simpler and more maintainable implementation.

### Dynamic CDS Archives

Application Class-Data Sharing (CDS) archives can be created dynamically.

## Deprecations and Removals

- Removed `java.security.acl` package
- Removed `java.security.Certificate` interface

## Migration Notes

- Text Blocks and Switch Expressions were preview features and required the `--enable-preview` flag
- Consider migrating to Java 17 LTS for production use
